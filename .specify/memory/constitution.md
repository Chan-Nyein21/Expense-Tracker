# Expense Tracker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST follow established quality standards to ensure maintainability and readability.
- Consistent naming conventions and formatting enforced by automated linting
- All functions and classes MUST have comprehensive documentation
- Code complexity metrics MUST not exceed defined thresholds (cyclomatic complexity < 10)
- All code MUST pass through mandatory peer review before merging
- Zero tolerance for code smells and technical debt accumulation

*Rationale: High code quality reduces maintenance costs, accelerates onboarding, and prevents technical debt from degrading development velocity.*

### II. Testing Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Comprehensive testing is mandatory to ensure application reliability and prevent regressions.
- Test-driven development (TDD) MUST be followed: Tests written → Implementation → Refactor
- Minimum 90% code coverage required for all new features
- All public APIs MUST have contract tests defining expected behavior
- Integration tests MUST cover all critical user workflows
- Performance tests MUST validate response times and resource usage

*Rationale: Robust testing prevents bugs in production, enables confident refactoring, and provides living documentation of system behavior.*

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces MUST provide consistent, accessible, and intuitive experiences.
- All UI components MUST conform to the established design system
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards MUST be met for all user-facing features
- User interactions MUST be consistent across all platforms and devices
- All features MUST be validated through user testing before release
- Responsive design MUST support mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

*Rationale: Consistent UX reduces user cognitive load, improves adoption rates, and ensures inclusive access to all users.*

### IV. Performance Requirements
Application performance MUST meet defined benchmarks to ensure optimal user experience.
- API response times MUST not exceed 200ms for critical operations
- Page load times MUST not exceed 3 seconds on standard connections
- Bundle sizes MUST not exceed 500KB compressed for client applications
- Database queries MUST be optimized with appropriate indexing
- Performance monitoring MUST be implemented with alerting for threshold violations

*Rationale: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, retention, and business outcomes. Proactive monitoring prevents performance degradation.*

## Quality Gates

All code changes MUST pass through automated quality gates to maintain standards.
- Continuous integration pipeline MUST validate all principles before merge approval
- Security scanning MUST identify and block vulnerabilities before deployment
- Code review MUST verify principle compliance and provide constructive feedback
- Automated testing MUST pass with minimum coverage thresholds met
- Performance benchmarks MUST be validated for all user-facing changes

## Development Workflow

Standardized development practices ensure consistent delivery and quality.
- Feature branch workflow with pull request approval required for all changes
- All features MUST include comprehensive documentation and testing
- Continuous deployment pipeline MUST automate staging and production releases
- Version control MUST follow semantic versioning for all releases
- Change logs MUST document all user-facing modifications and breaking changes

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and policies.
- All pull requests MUST include constitution compliance verification
- Principle violations MUST be documented and justified with business rationale
- Constitution amendments require team consensus and documented migration plan
- Regular quarterly reviews MUST assess principle effectiveness and necessary updates
- Complexity that violates principles MUST be refactored or formally justified
