   ‚Üí Actions: Add expenses, view expenses, track expenses over time
   ‚Üí Data: Expense records with amounts, categories, dates
   ‚Üí Constraints: Personal expense management context
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User authentication method not specified]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Multi-user vs single-user application]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Expense categorization requirements]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Reporting and analytics depth]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flow for expense management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Expense, Category, User entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚ö† WARN "Spec has uncertainties - multiple clarifications needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to manage my personal expenses by recording new expenses as they occur, viewing my expense history to understand my spending patterns, and tracking my expenses over time to make informed financial decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to record a new expense, **When** they provide expense details (amount, description, date), **Then** the expense is saved and can be retrieved later
2. **Given** a user has recorded multiple expenses, **When** they request to view their expenses, **Then** they see a list of all their expenses with relevant details
3. **Given** a user has expenses over a period of time, **When** they want to track spending patterns, **Then** they can see summaries and trends of their expenses
4. **Given** a user wants to organize expenses, **When** they categorize expenses, **Then** they can filter and group expenses by category
5. **Given** a user enters invalid expense data, **When** they attempt to save, **Then** they receive clear error messages and guidance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to add an expense with negative or zero amount?
- How does the system handle very large expense amounts?
- What occurs when a user tries to add an expense with a future date?
- How are duplicate expenses handled?
- What happens when expense data becomes corrupted or lost?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add new expenses with amount, description, and date
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate expense data (positive amounts, valid dates, required fields)
- **FR-003**: System MUST store and persist all expense records
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to view all their recorded expenses
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to edit existing expense records
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to delete expense records
- **FR-007**: System MUST support expense categorization for organization [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: predefined categories vs user-defined categories]
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide expense filtering by date range, category, and amount
- **FR-009**: System MUST calculate and display expense totals and summaries
- **FR-010**: System MUST show spending trends over time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific analytics requirements not defined]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle user authentication [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - local accounts, social login, or guest mode]
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure data privacy and security [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific security requirements not defined]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support multiple currencies [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: currency requirements not specified]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide data export capabilities [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export formats not specified]

### Key Entities
- **Expense**: Represents a single expense record with amount, description, date, category, and unique identifier
- **Category**: Represents expense classification for organization and filtering (e.g., Food, Transportation, Entertainment)
- **User**: Represents the person using the application to track their expenses, with associated preferences and settings
- **Summary**: Represents calculated aggregations of expenses for reporting and tracking purposes
