# Tasks: Expense Tracking Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-an-application/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Implementation plan found - vanilla JS web app with localStorage
   → Extract: HTML5/CSS3/ES6+, Chart.js, Jest/Cypress testing
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: 4 entities (Expense, Category, UserPreferences, ExpenseSummary)
   → ✅ contracts/: 3 contracts (StorageService, AnalyticsService, UI Components)
   → ✅ research.md: Architecture decisions and technical choices
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, npm config, tooling
   → Tests: contract tests for services, component tests, integration tests  
   → Core: models, services, UI components
   → Integration: app assembly, routing, state management
   → Polish: performance optimization, documentation, final testing
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. ✅ All contracts have tests, all entities have models, all features implemented
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths assume single project structure per implementation plan

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Create project structure (src/, tests/, public/) per implementation plan
- [x] T002 Initialize package.json with Jest, Cypress, Chart.js, ESLint, and Vite dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Configure ESLint with complexity rules (<10) in .eslintrc.js
- [x] T004 [P] Configure Jest testing environment in jest.config.js
- [x] T005 [P] Configure Cypress E2E testing in cypress.config.js
- [x] T006 [P] Create Vite development server config in vite.config.js

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. **Setup** (T001-T007) → Everything else
2. **Contract Tests** (T008-T022) → Implementation (T023-T046)
3. **Models** (T023-T026) → Services (T031-T032)
4. **Services** (T031-T032) → Components (T034-T038)
5. **Components** (T033-T039) → Integration (T040-T046)
6. **Integration** (T040-T046) → Polish (T047-T058)

### Specific Dependencies
- T031 (StorageService) depends on T023-T026 (models) and T027-T030 (utilities)
- T032 (AnalyticsService) depends on T031 (StorageService)
- T034-T038 (UI components) depend on T033 (Base Component)
- T040-T043 (App integration) depend on T031-T032 (services) and T034-T038 (components)
- T044-T046 (Templates/styles) can run parallel with other integration tasks

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = different files, no shared dependencies
- **TDD Critical**: All tests T008-T022 MUST fail before implementing T023+
- **Performance Target**: Bundle size <500KB, load time <3s, UI response <200ms
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
- **Browser Support**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% code coverage required
- Commit after each completed task
- Run `npm test` after each implementation task to verify tests pass

## Constitutional Compliance Checkpoints
- **T003**: ESLint complexity rules enforce <10 cyclomatic complexity
- **T008-T022**: TDD approach satisfies testing requirements
- **T044**: Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility
- **T051-T053**: Performance and compatibility testing
- **T056-T057**: Bundle size and performance monitoring
